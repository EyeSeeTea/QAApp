For Jadelle there are two rods while for Implanon and Nexplanon there is one rod.</li><li>A non-palpable implant should always first be localized by either ultrasound (USS) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before removal is attempted and subsequently be removed under guidance of USS. Such a case should be referred to a gynecologist for removal.</li><li>Mark both ends of the rod(s) or capsules using a ballpoint or marking pen. If an antiseptic containing alcohol will be used to prep the arm, a pen with permanent ink must be used.</li><li>Put on sterile gloves. Do not use gloves with powder. The tiny granules (talc) may fall into the removal site and cause scarring (fibrous reaction). If gloves are powdered, wipe powder off the glove fingers with sterile gauze soaked in sterile water.</li><li>Wash the area and apply an antiseptic.</li><li>Anaesthetize the arm with 1% lidocaine (4ml for Jadelle and 2 mls for Implanon and Nexplanon) starting with the site of incision, which is just below the distal end of the implant.</li><li>The local anesthetic is applied under the implant. Application above the implant makes the skin swell, which may cause difficulties in locating the implant.</li><li>Push down the proximal tip to fix the implant; a bulge may appear indicating the distal end of the implant. Starting below the distal tip of the implant, make a longitudinal incision of 2 mm towards the distal tip of the implant.</li><li>Gently push the implant towards the incision until the tip is visible. Grasp the implant with a mosquito forceps and remove.</li><li>If the tip of the implant is not visible, there might be formation of fibrotic tissue around the implant. The fibrotic tissue can be split by continuing to cut towards the distal tip, until the tip is clearly visible. Remove the implant with a mosquito forceps.</li><li>If the tip of the implant is still not visible, gently insert a forceps into the incision and grasp the implant, and with second forceps carefully dissect the tissue around the implant. The implant can then be removed.</li><li>Ensure that for Jadelle, two rods are removed.</li><li>Close the incision with a butterfly closure.</li><li>Show the patient the implant(s).</li><li>If the woman would like to continue using an implant, a new implant may be inserted.</li><li>Apply sterile gauze with a pressure bandage to prevent bruising.</li><li>If the woman does not wish to continue using an implant and does not want to become pregnant, another contraceptive method should be recommended.</li><li>If pregnancy is desired offer preconception care.</li><li>The arm should be kept dry for about 3 days.</li><li>Answer any questions the patient may have, give a return date and thank her.</li></ul><p>Reference-PSI Implant Sevice Delivery Protocol: Section 8.4</p></feedback>~20~63~8~0~22~~
